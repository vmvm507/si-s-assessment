1.	Changed navigation font color and move the new page “about” and “contact” to index. When user clicks the button it will automatically move to the section on the index, which is more convenient for the user to go through the whole page.
2.	There is too much redundant information on the web, remove learn more about us and get in touch because already have about and contact.
3.	The six little logo part is too blank, so I changed a little bit of the design to make the website more colorful and more likely emphasize each part, but I got a little bit of technical problem so I changed it by Photoshop instead of plain coding.
4.	Change the submit button color and font which makes it look like more comfortable and highlighted. Changed the select dropdown menu background and font color in order to make it style same with other input filed in the form.
5.	Combined the contact and get pre-approved, because the information user need to put in is similar.
